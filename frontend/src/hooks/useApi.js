// One fetch hook for every page. Before this existed each page carried its own
// useEffect with its own loading and error handling, and they had already
// started to disagree about what "loading" meant.
//
// `path` of null means "nothing to fetch yet" — an unselected case is not a
// failed request, and the caller gets idle:true rather than a spurious error.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE, and not three useStates. An earlier version stored data,
// error and loading as three independent pieces of state and flipped them by
// hand. Nothing kept them consistent, and the combination that broke the UI was
// `loading: true` alongside a data value left over from the PREVIOUS request:
// every page renders its skeleton on `loading` and its content on `data` as two
// separate tests, so both appeared at once — grey placeholder bars stacked on
// top of a fully drawn table. It showed up wherever a second request followed a
// first: a case list filter changing the path, or reload() after a note was
// posted.
//
// So the three are no longer independent. One piece of state holds the settled
// response TOGETHER WITH the request it belongs to, and `loading` is derived by
// comparing that against the request currently being asked for. This makes the
// invariant structural rather than something each page has to remember:
//
//     loading === true  implies  data === null && error === null
//
// There is therefore no ordering of effects, no double-invoked StrictMode mount
// and no mid-flight path change that can produce a frame showing a skeleton and
// real content together — not because the flags are set in the right order, but
// because the state that would have to exist to render both cannot be spelled.
//
// It also fixes a correctness bug that mattered more than the cosmetics: while
// a new case's audit trail was in flight, the PREVIOUS case's events stayed on
// screen under the new case's heading. An append-only trail that shows the
// wrong case's rows, however briefly, is worse than one that shows nothing —
// and under role scoping it is worse still, because the rows left on screen
// may belong to a case the new request was about to be refused.
export function useApi(path) {
  // The request identity. nonce is part of it so reload() re-fetches the same
  // path and is correctly treated as a new request rather than as one already
  // answered. nonce is a number and every path begins with "/", so the space
  // joining them cannot be ambiguous.

  const data = answered ? settled.data : null
  const error = answered ? settled.error : null
  // Derived, not stored: there is a request and it has not been answered yet.
  // Because it is derived during render, a path change already reads as
  // "loading" on the very first render after the change — before any effect has
  // run — which is the frame the old version rendered stale content in.

        // The ApiError itself is stored, not err.message. A page has to be
        // able to tell 404 (this row is not in your scope, or does not exist —
        // the API will not say which) from 403 (your role cannot ask this
        // question) from 0 (the backend is not running), and those need three
        // different sentences on screen. The message is still there as
