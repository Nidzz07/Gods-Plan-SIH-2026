// Page texture, not page imagery.
//
// The reference is security paper: the faint ruled ground under a land record,
// the watermark in a certificate, the ticked margin of an inspection register.
// Something you only notice when you go looking for it, whose whole job is to
// make the sheet feel like an official sheet rather than a blank one. If a
// motif on this page ever draws the eye, it is wrong, and the fix is to remove
// a line or drop the opacity — never to make it prettier.
//
// CONTRAST DISCIPLINE, enforced here so no page has to remember it:
//
//   1. Opacity is capped in this file, at a value picked by sweeping the
//      candidates against real text rather than by eye. Navy at 10% over the
//      #FAF8F4 ground lands at #E3E3E3. Against that, body ink (#14171A)
//      reads 14.02:1 and ink-secondary (#5B6169) — the lightest type that
//      ever sits on bare ground — reads 4.87:1, clear of the 4.5:1 AA floor
//      with room to spare. AA survives as far as 14% (4.51:1), which is
//      exactly why the cap is not there: a floor reached with no margin is a
//      floor one future tweak breaks. ink-muted (#94989E) would not clear it
//      at any opacity including zero, but ink-muted only ever appears inside
//      a card, and cards are opaque (see 3).
//   2. The layer is masked to fade in over the first 200px, which softens the
//      texture under the page header band but does NOT clear it: the band runs
//      to roughly 112px, where the mask is still better than half open. The
//      fade is a gradient, not a cutoff, so it cannot be what protects text.
//      Occlusion does that — see 3.
//   3. The layer sits at z-index -10 inside the page's own `isolate` stacking
//      context. Negative z paints BEFORE descendant backgrounds, so anything
//      with an opaque background covers the motif completely. That is why
//      every container holding text carries one: bg-surface on cards and rows,
//      bg-bg on the header band, the section headings (SectionHeading.jsx),
//      the table header rows, the filter bars and the ladder's connector
//      strip. Text NEVER sits on the bare layer — a watermark between the
//      letterforms of a heading is the failure this rule exists to prevent.
//      What is left for the texture is the true empty space: the gutters
//      between cards, the gaps between sections, and the tail below the last
//      row. That is the only place it is allowed to be.
//
// One component with a `variant` prop rather than seven hand-rolled
// backgrounds, so those three rules have exactly one place to be broken.

// Uniform across the tiling motifs. A variant is allowed to differ in what it
// draws, not in how loud it is — that is what stops one page's texture creeping
// up on the others.
//
// Every motif draws at a 1-unit line weight and lands between 2% and 4% ink
// coverage per tile, so no page's texture is meaningfully heavier than
// another's.
const OPACITY = 0.1

// The sign-in watermark is the mark itself at 720px, where the frame stroke is
// 56px of solid navy rather than a 1px rule. Equal alpha on those two does not
// read as equal presence — at 10% the watermark stops being a watermark and
// starts being a shape on the page — so it takes a lighter value to land at
// the same weight the ruled motifs do.
const OPACITY_MARK = 0.08

// The header band on every page is about 100-120px tall. Fading in over 200px
